### **1. Creating Product Backlogs**

The product backlog is a prioritized list of features, enhancements, bug fixes, and technical work required to build and improve the system. Based on the `schema.ts` file, here are the items that should be included in the product backlog:

#### **Product Backlog Items**

1. **User Authentication System**

   - Implement user registration (e.g., `POST /api/auth/register`).
   - Implement user login with JWT token generation (e.g., `POST /api/auth/login`).
   - Add role-based access control (`userRoleEnum`: admin, staff, customer, etc.).

2. **Warehouse Management**

   - Create warehouses and assign managers (`warehouses.managerId` references `users.id`).
   - Track stock levels and update inventory (`products.stockQuantity`).

3. **Product Management**

   - Add products to the system (`POST /api/products`).
   - Categorize products using `categories` table.
   - Update product details (e.g., price, stock quantity).

4. **Order Processing**

   - Allow users to create orders (`POST /api/orders`).
   - Link orders to specific warehouses (`orders.warehouseId` references `warehouses.id`).
   - Generate invoices for orders (`invoices.orderId` references `orders.id`).

5. **Delivery Tracking**

   - Assign drivers to deliveries (`deliveries.driverId` references `users.id`).
   - Track delivery status (`deliveryStatusEnum`: pending, in_transit, delivered, failed).
   - Integrate GPS tracking for delivery routes.

6. **Complaint Handling**

   - Allow customers to file complaints (`complaints.orderId` references `orders.id`).
   - Resolve or escalate complaints (`complaintStatusEnum`: pending, resolved, escalated).

7. **Return Management**

   - Process product returns (`returns.orderId` references `orders.id`).
   - Send faulty products to service centers (`returns.serviceCenterId` references `serviceCenters.id`).

8. **Service Center Operations**

   - Register service centers (`POST /api/service-centers`).
   - Specialize service centers by brand (`serviceCenters.brandSpecialization`).

9. **Daily Stock Records**

   - Automate daily stock updates (`dailyStockRecords` table).
   - Track opening balance, incoming stock, outgoing stock, and closing balance.

10. **Reporting and Analytics**
    - Generate sales reports (`dailySalesRecord`).
    - Reconcile discrepancies between departments (Sales, Finance, Warehouse).

### **2. Sprint Planning**

Sprint planning involves breaking down the product backlog into smaller, actionable tasks for each sprint. Hereâ€™s how the backlog items can be organized into sprints:

#### **Sprint 1: Core Features**

- **User Authentication**
  - Implement user registration and login.
  - Add JWT-based authentication for protected routes.
- **Warehouse Setup**
  - Create warehouses and assign managers.
  - Add basic inventory management functionality.

#### **Sprint 2: Product and Order Management**

- **Product Management**
  - Add products and categorize them.
  - Allow updating product details (price, stock).
- **Order Processing**
  - Enable order creation and linking to warehouses.
  - Generate invoices for orders.

#### **Sprint 3: Delivery and Complaint Handling**

- **Delivery Tracking**
  - Assign drivers and track delivery status.
  - Integrate GPS tracking for delivery routes.
- **Complaint Handling**
  - Allow customers to file complaints.
  - Resolve or escalate complaints.

#### **Sprint 4: Returns and Service Centers**

- **Return Management**
  - Process product returns.
  - Send faulty products to service centers.
- **Service Centers**
  - Register service centers and specialize by brand.

#### **Sprint 5: Reporting and Optimization**

- **Daily Stock Records**
  - Automate daily stock updates.
  - Track stock movements (opening, incoming, outgoing, closing balance).
- **Reporting**
  - Generate sales reports.
  - Reconcile discrepancies between departments.

### **Key Notes**

- Each sprint should last 1-2 weeks, depending on team capacity.
- Prioritize high-impact features (e.g., user authentication, order processing) in early sprints.
- Use tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana to manage the product backlog and sprint tasks.
- Conduct daily stand-ups to track progress and address blockers.

This approach ensures a structured and efficient development process while aligning with Scrum principles. ðŸ˜Š
